A landing page is a standalone web page designed to focus on a specific goal, such as promoting a product, service, event, or campaign.
Unlike other pages on a website (like homepages), landing pages are intentionally created with a single purpose and minimal distractions, often targeting a specific audience.
A landing page typically includes:

HTML: The main structure of your webpage.
CSS: Styling to make your page visually appealing.
JavaScript (optional): For adding interactivity.
Assets: Images, fonts, and other media files.
Organize these files in a project folder. For example:

bash
Copy code
landing-page/
├── index.html          # Main landing page file
├── style.css           # CSS styling
├── script.js           # Optional JavaScript
└── assets/             # Images and other media
